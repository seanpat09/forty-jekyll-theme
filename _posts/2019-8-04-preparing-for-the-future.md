title: Preparing for the Future
description: First and foremost, we have to acknowledge that the future has to be GREEN or there is no future! This means we have to do the work now. The technology age is coming fast, and local government is where this transition can happen because we are closest to the people. As Mayor, I will strive to partner with workers, businesses that put workers first, and other policy makers on all levels to make this critical transition a reality.

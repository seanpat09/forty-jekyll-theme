title: Air Quality Concerns
description: As a Public Servant, I have made sure to not only have a presence in the community, but to listen to the concerns of my constituents. Knowing that our air quality is an F-rating, it doesn’t surprise me to find that a common thread is respiratory and health issues. Being who I am, I can’t turn a blind eye. No matter how much we have accomplished in providing amenities, it means nothing if the air we all share and need to survive is no longer breathable.

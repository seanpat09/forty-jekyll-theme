title: Meet Steve
description: As a current Councilman in my eighth year of serving, I am prepared and ready to take on the challenging position of Mayor. Even before taking office, I was engaged in the community, serving on many boards and commissions which prepared me for office. I have found the key to success is to become engaged, stay engaged, always be accessible, and always follow through, no matter the outcome. I understand the value of being consistent, genuine, and true to your beliefs with courage to speak out - and then to stand by your convictions. The highest compliment I have ever received is to hear someone say that I am genuine, and that they trust me. I am running because I feel like each person in Commerce City matters, and they deserve to have what everyone else might take for granted – the best that life has to offer.

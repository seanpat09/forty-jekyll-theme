title: Advocating for You
description: I want to see working families get a better “shake” in life because I can see that the middle class is under attack. I also want our residents who are people from other countries to know that they belong here. Feeling safe and secure creates the ability to thrive. I want all of our residents to feel like they can thrive living in our city. All people living here should realize the opportunity for a quality life, not just some, but everyone. I also want people to see that together we’re better, so really getting everyone to see we’re more alike than we realize will open doors for the people of our city that we never knew were there.
